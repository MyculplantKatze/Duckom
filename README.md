# Duckom
a simple image replace for anyone who finds Chromebooks lack personality, needs to be in devmode and likely rootfs gone
i am still working on the process as i dont have git on my chromebook yet, and that is a must, im in the process of adding it but i am trying to avoid adding chromebrew as i am still learning and i like a challenge, if you want to use these images just plop them into /usr/share/chromeos-assets
copy all of the battery alerts and boot_splash frames to images_100 AND 200
the spinner goes in /usr/share/chromeos-assets/images/spinner
